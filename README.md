**Analysis:**
Based on the data, we have a total of 15 schools with 39,170 students and a combined budget of approximately $24,649,428. The goal of this analysis is to determine which school has the highest percentage of overall passing scores, considering factors such as grade, school type, and dedicated budget. The dataset includes two main school types: charter schools and district schools.

**Summary of Analysis**:
Bailey High School, with 4,976 students, has the highest number of students among all schools. The average budget per student at Bailey is $628.
Huang High School has the highest average budget per student in the dataset.
Pena High School has the highest passing scores for both math and reading, with 84% in math and 83% in reading, placing it among the top schools.
Cabrera High School has the highest overall passing score of 91.33%, with a budget of $582 per student, making it the top performer overall.
The overall passing rate for math and reading combined across all schools is 65.2%. For individual subjects:

The overall math passing rate is 75%.
The overall reading passing rate is 85%.
Among the schools, Bailey High School has the highest number of students passing both the math and reading tests (with over 2,719 students passing at a rate greater than 70%).

When analyzing the trend in math and reading scores by grade level, there is no clear or consistent trend. The scores fluctuate, going up and down, without any obvious pattern.

**Conclusion:**
A key takeaway from the analysis is that while spending tends to increase, the overall passing scores generally decrease. This suggests that spending may not directly correlate with better performance in this dataset.
Another important takeaway is that charter schools appear to perform better, even with lower spending rates compared to district schools.
